# Positive Definite Matrices — Summary Notes

## Definition
A **positive definite matrix** (real case) is a **symmetric matrix** \(A\) such that

$$
x^\top A x > 0 \quad \text{for all } x \neq 0
$$

Symmetry is part of the definition (or can be assumed without loss of generality).

---

## Eigenvalue Characterization
For a real symmetric matrix \(A\):

- \(A\) is **positive definite** if and only if  
  all eigenvalues of \(A\) are **strictly positive**.

This equivalence follows from the spectral theorem.

## Eigen-Decomposition and Factorization
Any real symmetric matrix admits an eigen-decomposition:

$$
A = P D P^\top
$$

where:
- \(P\) is an orthogonal matrix \((P^\top P = I)\)
- \(D\) is a diagonal matrix

If \(A\) is positive definite:
- All diagonal entries of \(D\) are positive
- We can write:

$$
D = \sqrt{D}\,\sqrt{D}
$$

Substituting:

$$
A = P \sqrt{D}\,\sqrt{D} P^\top
$$

Rearranging:

$$
A = (\sqrt{D} P^\top)^\top (\sqrt{D} P^\top)
$$

So:

$$
A = R^\top R
$$

This is the basis of the **Cholesky factorization**.

---

## Symmetric and Skew-Symmetric Decomposition
Any real matrix \(A\) can be uniquely decomposed as:

$$
A = S + K
$$

where:
- Symmetric part:
  $$
  S = \tfrac12 (A + A^\top)
  $$
- Skew-symmetric part:
  $$
  K = \tfrac12 (A - A^\top)
  $$

---

## Why Positive Definiteness Depends Only on Symmetry
A skew-symmetric matrix satisfies:

$$
K^\top = -K
$$

For any vector \(x\):

$$
x^\top K x = 0
$$

Therefore:

$$
x^\top A x = x^\top S x
$$

➡️ The **skew-symmetric part contributes nothing** to the quadratic form.

---

## Final Summary
- Positive definite matrices are **real symmetric matrices**
- They satisfy:
  $$
  x^\top A x > 0 \quad \forall x \neq 0
  $$
- All eigenvalues are **strictly positive**
- They factor naturally as:
  $$
  A = R^\top R
  $$
- Only the **symmetric part** of a matrix affects \(x^\top A x\)
